.SH "NAME"
\fBxedit\fR \- a text editor inspired by Acme from Plan 9 and Inferno
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBxedit\fR [\fIfile\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBxedit\fR is a text editor inspired by the Acme editor from the Plan 9 and Inferno operating systems\. Unlike Acme, \fBxedit\fR is a single window, single file editor\. Instead of baking a window manager into the editor, this job is relegated to an X11 window manager\. It is recommended that \fBxedit\fR be used with a tiling window manager such as dwm(1) or spectrwm(1)\. These window managers will make dealing with multiple windows much easier and more efficient\.
.
.SS "Windows"
\fBxedit\fR windows are divided into four basic regions: a one\-line status, an expanding tags region, a main content region and an adjacent scroll region\. The status region contains a set of symbolic flags indicating the current state of the editor followed by the path of the file being edited\. The tags region acts as scratch buffer for commands that can be executed to affect the file or the state of the editor\. As the content of this region grows it will expand up to a quarter of the size of the window shrinking the main coantent region in kind\. The main content region displays a view of the file currently being edited\. To the left of the content region is a narrow vertical region matching the height of the content region\. This region acts as a scrollbar for the content region\.
