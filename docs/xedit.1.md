# xedit -- a text editor inspired by Acme from Plan 9 and Inferno

## SYNOPSIS

    `xedit` [_file_]

## DESCRIPTION

`xedit` is a text editor inspired by the Acme editor from the Plan 9 and Inferno
operating systems. Unlike Acme, `xedit` is a single window, single file editor.
Instead of baking a window manager into the editor, this job is relegated to an
X11 window manager. It is recommended that `xedit` be used with a tiling window
manager such as dwm(1) or spectrwm(1). These window managers will make dealing
with multiple windows much easier and more efficient.
